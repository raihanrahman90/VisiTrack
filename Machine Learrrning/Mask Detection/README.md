# Face Mask Detection
## Dataset Overview
The dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/prithwirajmitra/covid-face-mask-detection-dataset). This dataset contains about 1006 images with 503 images containing images of people wearing masks and 503 images with people without masks, for mask and nonmask. You can download the datasets and upload it on your google drive or local storage.  
## Build and Train Model on _Google Colaboratory_
1. Click on "Facemask Detection VisiTrack.ipynb"
2. Open the file using _Google Colab_
3. Enable the GPUs for the notebook 
4. Click on "Runtime" then choose "Run All" or press Ctrl+F9 on keyboard
5. Wait the process until finished (about 5-10 minutes) to train the model
6. Or you can run it manually on each cell or row to see how each process works
7. After the training is done, download the model (Mask_detection.h5)
8. The model can be deploy as API to be use on another platform to make a real-time facemask detection using camera or video
